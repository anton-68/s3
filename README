1. INTRODUCTION

S3 is a simple proxy-style SIP-to-H.323 gateway.



2. LICENSE NOTES

S3 is licensed under MPL2.0 (http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/). It includes some
modifications of OPAL and therefore in this part is 'incompatible with
secondary licenses' according to MPL terminology. Necessary notes put in the
preambles of the source files containing borrowed code.



3. CURRENT STATE

S3 is under development at the moment (it is not released yet!). To be more precise
it is a in check-of-concept stage. 

Currently it is able to handle only H323-to-SIP calls and only with fast connect 
enabled.

So far S3 supports only G.711/G.722 for audio and H.264 for video (although it doesn't
process media and even doesn't provide bypass it has to provide the media
description translation/negotiation between H.245 and SDP).



4. PREREQUISITES

- PTLIB 2.10.5 + OPAL 3.10.5 must be installed 
- g++ tool-chain



5. RUNNING S3

- download and unpack S3; run make; run ./s3

The command-line keys are:

-v vv ... vvvvv  verbosity (default behavior = silent) 
-p - SIP port (default = 5060) 
-r - route string (default = "")

By default S3 sends all incoming H.323 calls to <user-name>@localhost:5060. This
can be changed by providing another route string (which must be prepared in OPAL
format - see AddRouteEntry method documentation on http://www.opalvoip.org/docs
/opal-v3_10/dc/d62/classOpalManager.html)

E.g. to route all calls to user1@192.168.0.108 you can use
"h323:.*=sip:user1@192.168.0.108" and to provide routing to localhost with the
original user-name (H.323 id) use "h323:.*=sip:da@127.0.0.1" (which is default
route).
	


6. ROADMAP

More or less in undefined order and timeframe the following features are
considered for implementation:

- Refactoring of OPAL integration part.
- Adding SIP-to H.323 calls.
- Adding proper handling of RoundTripDelay.
- Adding translation of intraframe requests.
- Implementing support for 'slow' connect.
- Implementing other scenarious outside basic successful call (reINVITEs etc.).
- Extending set of services (DTMF, messaging, H.239 etc.).
- Extending of media formats set.
- Implementing media bypass and traversal.
- Providing advanced config (flexible routing and smart media negotiation).
- Demonize.
